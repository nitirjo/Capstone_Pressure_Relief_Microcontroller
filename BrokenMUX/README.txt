This sketchbook is for the broken MUX.

In the prototype, port 0 is broken, so this sketchbook shifts over most
of the IMU ids over by 1 to accomodate.

When using this, connect IMU0 to port 1, IMU1 to port 2, etc.

If the MUX is working properly, DO NOT use this sketchbook.

Otherwise this is identical to WheelchairSensor.
